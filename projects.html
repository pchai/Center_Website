            An established self-regulation strategy (i.e., mental contrasting with implementation intentions; summary by Oettingen, 2012) is used to instigate either slow (reflective) or fast (reflexive) decision making. It is then assessed for what type of decision problems one or the other style of making decisions is more conducive to arrive at selfish or fair decision outcomes.

          <strong>Motivated Information Processing: A Policy Case</strong>

            Why do people so often hold tight to their political attitudes, even in the face of contradictory evidence? This project focuses on the ways in which our goals and desires can shape how we evaluate, remember, and experience politically relevant information. Several policy issues in the United States today are highly contentious. Disagreement at times centers not on how best to tackle the problem, but on whether the problem exists. This project draws from several literatures to hypothesize that the motivation to protect the economic system in the United States may impact the way that individuals process information about policy issues. <br><br>

            System Justification Theory posits that individuals are motivated to defend, bolster, and justify the socioeconomic and political arrangements in which they live. This motivation is stronger in some people than others and can also be affected by situational factors. System justification is often beneficial in the short term, in that it alleviates the anxiety, uncertainty, and fear elicited by threats to the status quo. However, in the long term system justification can interfere with intentions or active attempts to correct system-level problems. Recent empirical evidence indicates that, to the extent that policy initiatives are seen as threatening to our economic competitiveness, individuals may be motivated to deny problems in order to maintain the societal status quo. This research has also demonstrated that ideological differences in policy attitudes between those who identify as partisans are at least partially due to individual differences in system justification motivation. <br><br>

            But how are policy beliefs maintained in the face of contrary evidence? Recently, political scientists have begun to explore the possibility that the way we interpret political information is driven largely by motivational forces. In this dissertation, I explore the hypothesis that system justification motivation biases processing of policy evidence. Using surveys, qualitative data, and experimental methods collected from diverse samples across the United States, I examine the perceptual and cognitive mechanisms by which system justification motivation operates. Specifically, I explore how the public processes information, both in their day-to-day lives and when exposed directly to new information. Using knowledge gleaned from these studies, I will then explore potential interventions to help individuals overcome the effects of system justification motivation and redirect them toward more accurate processing of policy information. <br><br>

            This research integrates theory and methods from political science and social psychology. In doing so, it aims to make basic and applied contributions to the political information processing, motivated cognition, system justification, and policy attitudes literatures. First, it aspires to offer a more nuanced consideration of the psychological underpinnings of political identification in order to better understand ideological and partisan variability in resistance to change. Second, this research hopes to demonstrate that cognition may be affected by situational, system-serving needs rather than merely the desire to maintain one?s own prior beliefs or the beliefs of one?s social groups. Third, it offers a political psychological account for the ineffectiveness of policy education and programs to address disagreement. <br><br>

          The <a href="http://smapp.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">SMaPP</a> team is working on an interdisciplinary research project that has been funded by the NYU
          Research Investment Fund and the INSPIRE program of the National Science Foundation. The project is
          entitled “Computer Learning of Dynamical Systems to Investigate Cognitive and
          Motivational Effects of Social Media Use on Political Participation.”
          <br/>
          <br/>

          Our goals are fourfold:
          <ol>
            <li>
            To formalize and test a dynamic, integrative theory of the cognitive and motivational effects of social media on political participation;
            </li>
            <li>
            To design computer programs to extract meaningful slices of data from existing social media platforms such as Twitter;
            </li>
            <li>
            To identify “best practices” with respect to techniques for culling, analyzing, and annotating complex social network
            data and to apply these practices in our research (e.g., by focusing on single events and scaling upward
            to handle extremely large samples of events and participants);
            </li>
            <li>
            To offer definitive empirical conclusions concerning the causal mechanisms by which social media affects political participation (by
            integrating the use of original panel surveys and data from social media sources).

            The research supported by this grant analyzes whether implementation intentions (if-then plans) can be used to promote deliberative mindsets thus arriving at thoughtful decisions. Different decision making paradigms are employed reaching from the ultimatum game, to sunk cost situations and negotiation tasks (e.g., sharing common goods).

          <strong>When and How Moral Beliefs Give Purpose to Moral Action: A Dynamic Model of Moral Decision-making.

          <p>
            For decades, psychologists believed that moral action was determined by conscious reasoning. Recently, theorists have argued that moral intuitions are automatically triggered and enacted prior to conscious reasoning. We offer a potential reconciliation of these two perspectives. We propose that: (1) moral beliefs affect decision-making and action; (2) these beliefs are not necessarily automatically activated, but are influential when people operate in a moral mindset—which can be adopted intentionally; and (3) these beliefs influence attentional processes, which can increase their influence on behavior. In sum, moral mindsets increase the strength with which conscious moral beliefs predict action. In alternative mindsets, moral beliefs may go unexpressed.

          <strong>Youth Vocational Training and Conflict Mitigation: An Experimental Test of Social Contact Theory in Nigeria.

            <br>
            Can grassroots-level interventions that increase contact between members of groups in conflict improve inter-group relations? We propose an education-based field experiment – the Urban Youth Vocational Training Project (UYVT) – to test whether sustained contact between members of groups in conflict can reduce prejudice and discrimination, increase cooperation, and reduce participation in and support for violence. We will implement the UYVT program in Kaduna and Jos, two cities in northern Nigeria that have experienced deadly Christian-Muslim riots over the past decade, resulting in residential segregation and diminished social contact across religious lines.

            <br>
            We will create a business and computer training program that will allow us to structure sustained interactions over a period of four months for a sample of 800 Christians and Muslims in Kaduna and Jos. To evaluate whether there is a causal relationship between participation in the UYVT program and changes in inter-group attitudes and behavior, recruitment into the program and assignment to classrooms, learning partners and instructors will be randomized. We will embed the UYVT program within a carefully designed research project that includes detailed pre-program data collection on participants and control group members, in-depth qualitative observation of participants during the program itself, post-treatment data collection, and a six-month follow-up survey with program participants and the control group.
