                      Jonathan Nagler is Professor of Politics at New York University.
                      He received his AB in government from Harvard University
                      in 1982, and his Ph.D. from Caltech in 1989.  He has been a visiting
                      associate professor at Caltech and Harvard, and has taught at the
                      Summer Program, European Consortium for Political Research, Essex
                      University, England, and the Summer Program, Inter-university
                      Consortium for Political and Social Research, University of Michigan,
                      as well as the ESRC Oxford Spring School in Quantitative Methods for
                      Social Research.  In 2012 Professor Nagler was a Fernand Braudel Fellow
                      at the European University Institute. Professor Nagler's research
                      focuses on voting and elections.<br><br>

                      Professor Nagler published a series of articles, co-authored with
                      R. Michael Alvarez, on multiple-candidate elections that have examined
                      the relative importance of issues and the state of the economy to
                      voters.  Professor Nagler's work on strategic voting in British
                      elections (with R. Michael Alvarez) won the 1998 Durr award.  Over the
                      last 18 years he has also published a series of papers with Jan
                      E. Leighley on the factors influencing voter turnout in the United
                      States. They have just completed a book on voter turnout in the
                      United States from 1972 to 2008.  Professor Nagler has also published
                      articles on the voting behavior of Latinos and women.<br><br>

                      Professor Nagler is currently working on the impact of economic
                      conditions on voting in presidential elections, and the impact of
                      California's Top 2 Election law. His work has been supported by several grants from the
                      National Science Foundation.  In addition to his research, he
                      established the world wide web site of the Political Methodology
                      Section of the American Political Science Association, and served as
                      president of the association from 2001-2003. Professor Nagler is a
                      former editor of The Political Methodologist.  An estimator he developed
                      for the study of voter turnout, Scobit, is incorporated in the STATA
                      statistical package.  He is an Inaugural Fellow of the Society for
                      Political methodology.
                      Professor Nagler has served as an expert witness on court casees on
                      primary reform and election law, and has consulted for presidential
                      campaigns and media surveys.  Nagler has appeared as a guest or been
                      interviewed on CNN, MTV, and Fox-News, as well as National Public Radio.
