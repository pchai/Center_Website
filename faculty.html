                      <small>I am interested in the conscious and nonconscious ways people fundamentally orient to the world. In particular, I focus on how the motivations, emotions, needs, and goals people hold impact the basic ways people perceive, interpret, and ultimately react to information around them. I advocate for an interactive cognitive system where psychological states constrain the basic manner in which we perceive and react to our worlds. My work, then, explores motivational biases in visual and social perception and the consequential effects for behavior and navigation of the social world. In doing so, my research represents an intersection among social psychology, judgment and decision-making, social cognition, and perception.</small>

                    <p>
                        <small>My current research is part of a longstanding program of investigation concerning gender stereotypes and how they bias evaluations of women in work settings.  There are three separate research interests that currently predominate.<br>
 
                        The first concerns the way in which the perceived lack of fit between stereotypes of women and perceptions of the requirements for jobs considered to be male in gender type leads to negative performance expectations, and resulting gender bias in judgments.  We have shown, for example, that women, as compared to men, are less likely to be selected for male gender-typed positions, are more likely to have their performance in such positions devalued, and are given fewer opportunities for career advancement.  More recently, we have focused on the tenacity of stereotype-based expectations and their resistance to disconfirming information.  For example, we have demonstrated a process we call “attributional rationalization”, in which a woman member of a successful team is unlikely to get as much credit for a team’s success as her male counterpart, and she is seen as having been less influential in bringing about the successful outcome.  We are currently investigating other ways in which positive performance information about women is distorted so as to maintain gender stereotypes, and are examining the ways in which perceptions of femininity, such as being a mother or being attractive, can exacerbate stereotyped-based bias.<br>
                         
                        The second research interest concerns the unintended negative effects of preferential selection on those who have been targeted to benefit from it.  On the one hand we are interested in the reactions of others to those who are believed to have been preferentially selected through diversity or affirmative action programs.  On the other hand, we are interested in how those people who believe they have been preferentially selected for important positions feel about themselves and their work, and how they perform on the job as a consequence.   To date, we have demonstrated that a stigma of incompetence is attached to those perceived to have obtained their positions through a preferential selection procedure.  We also have demonstrated that preferential selection as compared to merit-based selection can result in a more negative view of self and performance, a greater desire to relinquish a leadership role, a greater incidence of mistreatment of similar others, and an increased choice of undemanding and routine tasks.  Current work focuses on the cues people use to infer that preferential selection has in fact occurred.<br>
                         
                        The third research interest involves gender stereotypic norms, which dictate the ways in which women should behave, and the disapproval and approbation women experience for violating these “shoulds”.  We have looked at reactions to actual violations of prescribed behaviors, demonstrating that women who choose not to help others are reacted to far more negatively than males who behave similarly, and are given less credit when they do help.  Moreover, we have looked at inferred violations of gender norms, and shown that women are penalized for being successful in domains that are considered to be male, and are disliked and interpersonally derogated as a consequence.  We have further probed the dynamics underlying this process, and have considered why women join men in penalizing women for their success, whether men also are subjected to penalties when they are successful in gender inconsistent domains, and the ways in which a woman’s perceived femininity can intensify or ameliorate these effects.   In addition, we currently are addressing the question of whether women’s anticipation of being penalized for gender norm violation leads to self-censorship of self advocating behaviors in an effort to stave off negative reactions.<br>

                    People dedicate a great deal of conscious and unconscious thought to the groups they're in and the groups  they're not in. I study how such intergroup thought affects our behavior and attitudes -- with a particular focus on political judgment. For instance, I'm conducting research examining the extents to which White Americans' political attitudes and behavior are driven by ingroup-focused concerns (e.g., racial identity), outgroup-focused concerns (e.g., prejudice against non-Whites), or ostensibly group-neutral ideology (e.g., conservatism). I also have active interests in religious-group prejudice, interracial interaction, and the interplay of intergroup thinking and Theory of Mind.

                    I am interested in how values, identities and motivations organize social perception and evaluation, and the underlying neural mechanisms that mediate these processes. This work builds on some basic assumptions about the dynamic nature of human perception and evaluation that are different from the dual process models that permeate psychology. My primary line of research takes a multi-level approach to self-categorization and social identity, blending theory and methods from social psychology and cognitive neuroscience. Other lines of research explore the flexibility of moral judgment and the effects of social context and individual differences on social perception and evaluation.

                    Broadly speaking, my research focuses on understanding the nature and dynamics of social perception. Nearly all of my work examines basic processes in person perception at the level of the dyad and group, addressing both theoretical and methodological issues in the study of interpersonal and intergroup relations.<br>

                    My general line of research examines how the processes of social perception operate in same- and cross-group interactions, with a specific focus on relations between Whites and racial and ethnic minorities. I use a multi-method approach to studying dyadic- and group-level interactions. In this line of work, I am focusing on methods of improving communication between Whites and ethnic minorities in laboratory interactions and in daily interactions between college roommates.<br>

                    I also have a general theoretical interest in accuracy and bias in person perception, and I am currently developing new analytical methods for examining these two related perceptual processes.

                    The primary goal of my research is to identify and clarify the sources of individual differences in political preferences and behaviors. My work tends to utilize genetically informative samples, as well as experimental methods, in order to better understand why some individuals participate in politics while others do not, as well as the types of political acts citizens choose to engage in. My recent work studies these individual differences within and across several developed countries.

                    I am an Assistant Professor in the Wilf Family Department of Politics at New York University.<br>
                    I study comparative and ethnic politics, with a regional focus on Sub-Saharan Africa. My current book project investigates the micro-dynamics of ethnic conflict in contemporary Nigeria. In particular, I'm interested in the question of why ordinary people choose to participate in risky forms of collective action.<br>

                    Other ongoing research projects focus on post-conflict peacebuilding, the human costs of partition, electoral manipulation, ethnic identity formation, effective methods for asking sensitive questions, and the costs and benefits of respondent-driven sampling.<br>

                    In 2010, I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from Columbia University. During the 2009-2010 academic year, I was a fellow at Nuffield College, Oxford University.

                     <small>Rich Bonneau is an Associate Professor of Biology and Computer Science at NYU. Professor Bonneau's  laboratory is focused on two areas in computational and systems biology: 1) Predicting and designing protein and peptidomimetic structure and 2) Learning dynamic network models automatically from functional genomics data using scalable methods.<br><br>

                    In both research areas Professor Bonneau has played key roles in achieving critical field-wide milestones.In the area of structure prediction he was one of the early authors on the Rosetta code, which was one of the first codes to demonstrate accurate and comprehensive ability to predict protein structure in the absence of detectable sequence homology to proteins with known structures. His  lab continues to be a core contributor to the Rosetta research community, participating in the recent refactoring of the code and adding several new functionalities.<br><br>

                    Professor Bonneau's lab has also made key contributions to the area of genomics data analysis in a systems-biology context.  His lab  focuses on developing new methods for network inference that simultaneously learn dynamics and topology from data (the Inferelator), and methods that learn condition-dependent co-regulated gene groups from integrations of different genomics data- types (e.g. transcriptomic, proteomic, etc.) using approaches we have developed (cMonkey and multi-species-cMonkey integrative biclustering). In the DREAM3 and DREAM4 blind assessment of network inference methods they were top performers in the network inference category, and are currently contributing to a joint paper resulting from DREAM5 (the most current assessment of network inference methods).</small>

                    PJ Henry is a social psychologist studying prejudice and intergroup relations, with a focus on the effects of prejudice and discrimination on individuals. While prejudice is typically studied in the United States through the lens of the African-American experience, he is particularly interested in the different forms prejudice takes around the world and says his own study of prejudice has been defined by his studies overseas in Lebanon and Germany. He looks at the ways the Western and Arab worlds view each other, and how that can inform the understanding of prejudice as a global issue. At NYU Abu Dhabi he will be teaching introductory level psychology courses, as well as classes on social psychology and prejudice. Henry has taught around the world, spending a year as a Humboldt research fellow at Germany's University of Bielefeld and most recently working at DePaul University in Chicago, where he was nominated for an Excellence in Teaching award. He spent a year at the American University of Beirut, an experience he calls "life-changing" as an opportunity to live and study in a multi-ethnic, multi-religious society with both many shades of conflict and many ways of mediating differences. He has taught classes on statistics, mathematical and technological literacy, research methods, and seminars on intergroup conflict. Henry has been published in a host of professional journals, including the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology and Political Psychology. He holds his Ph.D. and M.A. in Social Psychology from the University of California Los Angeles, and a B.A. from the University of Wisconsin. In addition to his Humboldt Fellowship at Bielefeld, he did postdoctoral research at Yale University and the University of California, Santa Barbara.
