        <br><br>

        Professor Redlawsk's talk (with Doug Pierce) on May 10 will be entitled "Studying Information Processing with Dynamic Process Tracing: A First
        Look at Social Cues," and it will begin at 2:00 PM in Room 551 of the Meyer Bldg. (Psychology Dept.)
        (6 Washington Place, 5th Floor).
        <br><br>

        ABSTRACT:
        <br><br>

        Understanding how voters form preferences for candidates requires
        knowledge of information search strategies, which may be conditioned on
        factors such as the competitiveness of the election, the complexity of
        the information environment, individual dispositional factors, and
        emotional responses to candidates and issues. Existing research along
        these lines tends to focus on the individual and fails to treat information
        search as at least in part a social activity. In this talk I will
        introduce an experimental tool called the Dynamic Process Tracing
        Environment (DPTE) which has been successfully used to observe
        information search processes in complex information environments. In
        particular I will focus on a new extension to DPTE which allows the
        researcher to create a "social" environment, where information
        may be tagged with social cues either in a controlled experimental
        environment or by subjects themselves, or some combination. New data on
        effects of social cues on information search in a campaign environment
        will be presented and discussed, as we begin our initial studies using
        social experiments in DPTE.

        <br><br>
        There will also be a (free) catered lunch for Ph.D. students (and postdocs) with Professor Redlawsk 
        at 12:30 PM in the Politics Department (19 W. 4th Street), Room 212.  
        <br>
        (Please note that the lunch and talk will be held in different, albeit adjacent buildings).

        We hope very much that you will be able to join us!

        <strong>The NYU Center for Social and Political Behavior will hold its Inaugural Event on Friday, April 26, 2013.
        </strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        This will be a colloquium talk by Dr. Betsy Sinclair (University of Chicago), author of
        The Social Citizen: Peer Networks and Political Behavior
        <br>
        <a href= "http://www.amazon.com/The-Social-Citizen-Networks-Political/dp/0226922820" target="_blank">(http://www.amazon.com/The-Social-Citizen-Networks-Political/dp/0226922820)

        Her talk on April 26 will be entitled "Voters Like You: Social Group Cues in Behavior and Opinion", and it will begin at 2:00 PM in Room 217 of the Politics Dept
        (19 W. 4th Street).
        <br>
        <br>
        Abstract:
        <br>
        <br>
        We find that social group membership, operationalized as a psychological 
        affinity toward others who are "like you", causes individuals to mirror 
        the political behaviors and choices of similar others. We conduct two 
        experiments where we demonstrate the power of these impersonal social 
        group influences through social group cues. In these experiments, 
        providing the subjects with social group cues successfully alters both 
        behavior and opinion. In the field experiment, we demonstrate voters 
        change their behavior in accord with a message telling them about levels 
        of turnout among similar others. In the survey experiment, we demonstrate 
        respondents change their position on political issues based upon what 
        they are told about the positions of similar others. We find no evidence 
        that these effects are attributable to alternative mechanisms, such as 
        need for information, confirming the effects are likely caused by the 
        desire to adopt the appropriate political social norm.

        We hope very much that you will be able to join us!
